Learn/Unity to make this easy click based grind/tycoon game. 

Planned to release on Android but we will start on it for PC. 

Game Idea - A simple click/time game where you are an owner of a grocery store and it is your task to make money to support your store by checking out enough customers. 

Inspiration comes from game called "Lemonade stand tycoon" watch some videos of it. 
	
Each day would count as a round and it would last a certain amount of time ie. 1min. Before each day, it is required for you to pay for the set up by buying essential stock and paying your employees.

When the day starts, customers come into the store and start lining up to checkout. Clicking or tapping on the checkout till will make you check the customer out. It takes a small delay between start and end and it is dependent to the speed of the employee. 

The game would progress with upgrades and advertisement which would bring more customers and more revenue. The upgrades would assist with the speed you can cash out custoemers and how many. Stock levels before starting a round is where a player should decide to spend less on lesser quality and less of stock to cut close and not waste any but gain some unhappy customers or pay premium for groceries and buy more stock level to make sure you dont run out but are at risk of wasting money. 

The most basic part of the game that should be done first is:

- game goes through a level from 
	starting menu > game start/pause menu > level play > back to game start/pause after finishing a day
